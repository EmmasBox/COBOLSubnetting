# COBOLSubnetting
Simple program to get a custom subnet mask, made in COBOL (work in progress)
Features:
-Calcuate a subnet mask based on the amount of desired hosts
-Tell the user which class of network an IP address is
-Basic error handling to prevent impossible networks (i.e. trying to get it to create subnet mask for a class C network with over 254 hosts)
